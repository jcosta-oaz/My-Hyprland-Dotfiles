# My Hyprland Dotfiles
This repository contains my **Hyprland** dotfiles, including configs for **Wayland**, **kitty**, **Rofi**, **Waybar**, and other tools I use for productivity and system customization.

- Focused on **efficiency**, **aesthetics**, and **automation**.  
- Inspired by modern themes like **Catppuccin**, **Material Sakura**, **Gruvbox Retro**, and more.  
- Continuously updated with improvements and personal tweaks.

Here, ive decided to share my dotfiles of my current system Arch Linux: Hyprland, Wayland.
Feel free to explore, copy, or adapt these configs for your own setup. ðŸš€
